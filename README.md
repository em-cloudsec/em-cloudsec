# Earl Miller – Aspiring Cloud Security & Cloud Engineer

I’m Earl, a purpose-driven cloud security engineer in training, focused on AWS, security automation, and hands-on lab projects you can actually read and verify on GitHub.

My goals are simple:  
- Build real, verifiable AWS security projects.  
- Transition into a full-time Cloud Security or Cloud Engineer role.  
- Protect, provide, and create time freedom for my family through tech and entrepreneurship.

---

## What I’m Focused on Right Now

- Career Transition into Cloud Security and Cloud Engineering  
  Building the foundational and advanced skills required to secure AWS environments and support real-world cloud workloads.

- Learning, Implementing, Improving  
  Every concept becomes a project: learn a principle, implement it in AWS, break it, fix it, document it, and refine it.

- Developing Resume-Ready Cloud Security Projects  
  Turning practice labs into production-minded portfolio pieces that demonstrate:  
  - security reasoning  
  - architectural thinking  
  - automation  
  - evidence of controls working  

- Strengthening Core AWS Security Skills  
  IAM, VPC architecture, network boundaries, monitoring, logging, and incident response patterns.

- Building a Long-Term Foundation in Cloud, Security, and DevOps  
  Focusing on depth, repetition, and understanding why each control exists and how it aligns with real-world threats.

## Portfolio Hub

These are the primary repositories that represent my work:

### 1. Cloud Security Portfolio

Repository: [https://github.com/em-cloudsec/cloud-security-portfolio](https://github.com/em-cloudsec/Resume-Projects)

A structured portfolio of AWS cloud security projects.  
Each project includes:  
- Problem statement and scenario  
- Architecture and threat model  
- Implementation details (Terraform, AWS Console steps, CLI workflows, automation)  
- Evidence (logs, screenshots, configs)  
- Improvements for production environments  

### 2. Resume Projects

Repository: https://github.com/em-cloudsec/Resume-Projects

A curated collection of resume-ready projects pulled from hands-on labs, cloud builds, and security practice.  
Focused on clarity, relevance, and direct alignment with industry job requirements.

## Example Project Themes

These are the types of projects I’m currently building and improving:

| #  | Project                               | Focus Area                          | Technologies / Services              |
|----|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 01 | Secure Account Baseline               | IAM, root hardening, guardrails     | IAM, MFA, CloudTrail, SCPs           |
| 02 | Secure VPC Networking                 | Network segmentation, egress control| VPC, Subnets, IGW, NAT, NACLs, SGs   |
| 03 | CloudTrail and Logging Foundation     | Auditability and forensics          | CloudTrail, S3, CloudWatch Logs      |
| 04 | Monitoring and Alerting               | Detection and response              | CloudWatch Alarms, SNS               |
| 05 | Automated Security Checks and Audits  | Automation and compliance           | Bash/Python, AWS CLI, SSM, Config    |

Each project is documented with: overview, architecture, implementation, evidence, lessons learned.

## How I Approach Projects

1. Start with a real problem  
   Examples: securing identity access, building a controlled network boundary, logging every API action.

2. Design a simple but realistic architecture  
   Focus on clarity, security controls, and threat alignment.

3. Implement step-by-step  
   Using AWS Console, CLI, Terraform, and automation scripts when appropriate.

4. Prove that it works  
   Generate logs, test scenarios, trigger alerts, or create findings.  
   Capture evidence to show the system functioning as intended.

5. Improve and reflect  
   Document what would change in a production environment and note opportunities for future work.

## What I’m Learning Toward

- AWS security best practices across identity, networking, monitoring, and incident response  
- How to transform cloud labs into professional, interview-ready projects  
- Deeper understanding of cloud architecture patterns and secure-by-design principles  
- Automation skills that support cloud security engineering, DevSecOps, and modern cloud operations
